## About

This is a faithful Python port of the classic Lemonade Stand business simulation game, originally written in BASIC for 6502 processor systems.

From an original program by Bob Jamison, of the Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium.
Modified for the Apple February, 1979 by Charlie Kellner.

In this game, you run your own lemonade stand and try to make the most profit. Each day you decide:
- How many glasses of lemonade to make
- How many advertising signs to make
- What price to charge for each glass

Watch out for weather changes, random events, and don't go bankrupt!
